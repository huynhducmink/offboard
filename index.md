This project is developed to use the onboard computer for controlling the drone. 

It is based on ROS and MAVROS and includes some features:

- Keep drone hover at the certain height in configured time
- Perform a flight that follow the setpoints: local or global setpoint
- Input setpoints from keyboard or set in a config file

Quadrotor for test:

#### Frame and Power:
- Frame: Tarot Ironman 650 foldable
- Motor: T-Motor MN4010 KV580 - 4 units
- Prop: Cacbon (DJI form) 15x5.5in (CW and CCW) - 2 units
- ESC: Hobbywing XRotor 40A - 4 units
- Battery: 4s 1800mAh 45c - Two Units
- Power management: Pixhawk PM07 - 1 unit
- BEC: 5V 4A - 1 unit

#### Flight control and Sensor:
- Flight control: Holybro Pixhawk 4 - 1 unit
- GPS: Pixhawk Neo-M8N GPS module - 1 unit
- Onboard computer: NVIDIA Jetson Nano - 1 unit

#### Communication:
- Receiver: Frsky X8R - 1 unit
- Transmitter: Frsky Taranis Q X7 - 1 unit

### Hovering
- Get current position from drone via mavros topic
- Input a height (z) from keyboard to hover
- Set a target position with x = current position x, y = current position y and z = z input
- Get time to hover from a config file
- Publish target to drone and keep it hover in setup time
- Land after timeout

### Setpoint
- Get current position from drone via mavros topic, include local position and global position

  **local position**: position in x, y, z coordinates. Unit: meter
  
  **global position**: position in GPS: latitiude, longitude and altitude
- Choose position type:
  
  **local position**: target can be input from keyboard or load from config file
  
  **global position**: target also can be input or load as local position. after get target, have a conversion from GPS to x, y, z
- Publish target to drone and check when drone reach it. Continue until the final setpoint
- At each setpoint drone hover in a time. And at final setpoint, drone land after timeout
